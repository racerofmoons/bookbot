# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

I've gone a little deeper than the project initially required out of pure curiosity and to see if I can at my current skill level. 

Usage:
python3 main.py <path or url>

You can use any plain text file or any ebook on https://www.gutenberg.org/ or similar. 

If using a book on Guthenburg.org this bookbot will ignore anything outside of the actual transcription start and stop lines.

Is it useful? Probably not. But it was fun to build and I learned by doing it.
